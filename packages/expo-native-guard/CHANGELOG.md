# expo-native-guard

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Two independent tools for Expo monorepos on pnpm.
  
  - **expo-native-guard**: stop Expo Go crashes on native-only modules. Swap in a visible fallback
    instead, so the team stays unblocked in Expo Go without losing sight of what still needs a real
    native test pass.
  - **expo-pnpm-catalog**: run `expo-doctor` and `expo install --fix` correctly against pnpm catalog
    versions, and keep catalogs in sync with what Expo actually wants — no more version drift across
    the workspace.
